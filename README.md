Breast Cancer Detection

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using the Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on various features.
Dataset

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset contains features related to the characteristics of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies. Each feature describes a characteristic such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.
Methods

    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
        Applied hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal value of k.
        Achieved 94% accuracy with the best k.

    Random Forest Classifier:
        Built a random forest model to improve accuracy.
        Achieved 95% accuracy using the random forest classifier.
